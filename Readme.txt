To compile the code, use the command
	make all
Ignore the warnings that appear, they do not affect the code


The code was started from preexisting code I have written for Networks (CS 3516) that originally acted as an http client/server.
The original code was based on the Beej's guide as well as input from Professor Breecher.

run client
	./client <domain || IP> <port> <file>


	
run server
	./server <port>
